# hapesay

hapesay is written in Go. This hapesay is extended the original cowsay and [neo cowsay](https://github.com/Code-Hex/Neo-cowsay). It has more fun options than the original cowsay, and you can be used as a library.

## About hapesay

According to the [original](https://web.archive.org/web/20071026043648/http://www.nog.net/~tony/warez/cowsay.shtml) original manual.

```
cowsay is a configurable talking cow, written in Perl. It operates
much as the figlet program does, and it written in the same spirit
of silliness.
```

This is also supported `HAPEPATH` env. Please read more details in [#33](https://github.com/Code-Hex/Neo-cowsay/pull/33) if you want to use this.

## What makes it different from the original?

- fast
- utf8 is supported
- new some hapefiles is added
- hapefiles in binary
- random pickup hapefile option
- provides command-line fuzzy finder to search any hapes with `-f -` [#39](https://github.com/Code-Hex/Neo-cowsay/pull/39)
- coloring filter options
- super mode
